## Introduction

Computing models for binary data are limited in usage due to the intractability of computation *cite* . In this paper a class of probit-normal models is introduced. They describe ML and REML estimations using EM algorithm. EM algorithm proposed is similar to continuous normal linear model.
Computations are feasible for any number of structures of random effects and arbitrary number of fixed effects. ML estimation has been described only in nested models thus far *Check the progress since this paper was published.*

focus on variance estimation in mixed models and BLUP of observed values of random effects. Different than usualy repeated measures model, i that fixed effects are primary quantities of interest and random effects are nuisance.Do not consider covariance components models *Check if there is a paper that works on this.*

Benifits of correlated probit models over others:

1. Beta-binomial does not generalize easily to multiple random effects
2. Generalization of quasi likelihood methods focuses on fixed effects and only estimates var and covar as nuisance params.
3. prentice considers to estimating var covar but models a difficult to generalize.

The model proposed here is simplified version of threshold model *explain what threshold model is* 


## Model

### What is threshold model?

### What is probit model?

#### What is probit -normal model?

### What is logit model?

#### What is logit normal model?

Threshold model,

$$Y = X\beta +Z u +\epsilon,$$
$$ W_i = I_{Y_i >0}, i = 1,2,...,n,$$
$$Where, u \sim N(0,D) \;\;\;\; \epsilon \sim N(0, I),$$
$$ X \equiv diag\{1_{m_i}\} , i = 1,2,...,G$$

$$Z \equiv diag\{1_{n_{ij}}, j = 1,2,....m_i\}\;\; and \;\; \beta = \mu$$
u and \epsilon are independent
This model has restriction that negative correlations cannot be model.

the primary interest is estimation of D parameter i.e. the variances of random effects. 

Adavmntages of probit-normal model over logit-normal model:

1. with a single random effect and only one obeservation per level of random effect the proposed model reduces to usual probit model (with a different error term for $\epsilon$). This is not the same for logit models. 

2. The marginal mean of $\W_i$ haas simple representation,

$$E[W_i] = \Phi(x_i^t\beta(z_i^tDz_i +I)^{-1/2})$$
3. The EM algorithm takes form close to continous normal linear model.

Going forward the paper follows standard ANOVA model for variance components estimation,

$$Y = X \beta +\sum_{i=1}^r Z_i u_i +\epsilon$$
$$u_i \sim independently N_{q_r}(0,\theta_i I)$$
